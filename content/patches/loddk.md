# Legacy of Double Dealing Kingdom
"That was\.\.\. that was terrible" --Yatsuzume after getting Seija kicked  

What is this mod? The ultimate meme, I like to say. Basically it's a boss rush patch, except you fight bosses from both DDC and LoLK **at once**.

As you can imagine, some things get **really** nasty. The maingame is intended to be played on easy mode, though it is possible to cheese your way even through lunatic with Sanae's bombs.
The extra stage includes a difficulty choice - one contains unmodified patterns and is basically impossible, and the second one has patterns which were modified (and it's possible to nmnb it)

If you want to experience it yourself, you can download it [here](https://mega.nz/#!hlgX0AJB!MvrBq5qgfQTZFeoGwlY7GKTJEfC4s95tScC8wY2ZeAA).  
(or through thcrap, which is better because of automatic updates, if there are any.)
