## The general guide to modding ZUN's games
This short(ish) guide aims to explain how ZUN's modern engine he makes Touhou games with works. This includes some history of its evolution, what the different file formats do and what tools can be used to actually edit them. What will **NOT** be covered here is any in-depth information/tutorials that go over how to edit specific things exactly - instead, such things are explained in separate tutorials that can also be found on this site (still WIP), such as the [ECL tutorial](#b=ecl-tutorial/&p=1). Generally, the goal of this guide is to give basic knowledge that someone completely unfamiliar with modding ZUN's games doesn't have.
