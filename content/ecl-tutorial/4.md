## Bullet managers
Now that we have spawned our beautiful fairy, we should give a meaning to its existence by making it shot some bullets! However, shooting bullets in ECL is a bit more involved that just calling 1 instruction, but in the end that makes it easier to manage. Every enemy comes with a set of 16 bullet managers, with IDs from 0 to 15. Using IDs other than these can cause unpredictable issues, such as making your fridge explode. A bullet manager (also etMgr for short) has the following properties (among many others, but these are most important):
- bullet sprite and color
- bullet angle
- bullet aim mode (more on that later)
- bullet speed
- bullet amount
- \.\.\.and a lot more

A really nice things about bullet managers is that they allow easily defining some simple bullet formations, such as rings or fans. But first, we should focus on shooting a single bullet. etMgr can be initialized by using the [ins=600,13] instruction.  
[code]anim {
    "enemy.anm";
}

void main() {
    [ins=502,17](32);
    [ins=23,17](60);
    [ins=300,17]("MyEnemy", 0f, 128f, 1000, 100, 0);
    [ins=23,17](10000);
}

void MyEnemy() {
    [ins=302,17](2);
    [ins=306,17](0, 0);
    [ins=600,17](0); // initialize etMgr
    [ins=602,17](0, 6, 1); // set bullet sprite and color: 6 -> outline bullet, 1 -> red  
    [ins=601,17](0); // shoot the bullet - properties other than the sprite and color are default  
    [ins=23,17](10000);
}
[/code]  
After running the code above ingame, our fairy will shoot a single red bullet right as it spawns. Said bullet will actually be aimed at the player, since that's the default. Now, we shall discuss how bullet managers can be used to shoot multiple bullets at once.  

## Bullet counts, aim modes
As mentioned earlier, bullet managers actually allow creating simple patterns, that can then be fired by using just one [ins=601,17] instruction. There are 4 main instructions that define a bullet manager pattern: [ins=604,17], [ins=605,17], [ins=606,17] and [ins=607,17]:
- [ins=607,17] sets the aim mode, which determines how the other properties will actually be interpreted.
- [ins=606,17] sets the `cnt1` and `cnt2` properties of the bullet manager. How it's interpreted exactly depends on the aim mode, but in general the pattern fired by the manager will have `cnt1*cnt2` bullets.
- [ins=605,17] sets the `spd1` and `spd2` properties of the manager. In general `spd1` should be higher than `spd2` and the bullets will move with speeds ranging from `spd2` to `spd1`, but again, how it's interpreted exactly depends on the aim mode.
- [ins=604,17] sets the `ang1` and `ang2` properties of the manager. In general, `ang1` offsets the pattern angle from the one defined by the aim mode, while `ang2` is related to the difference between angles of individual bullets in the pattern.

With this in mind, we can now discuss how individual aim modes work.
### Modes 0 and 1 - the "fan" modes
These modes shot a pattern that looks like a fan. What I mean is something like this:  
[img=content/ecl-tutorial/files/4/fan.png]  
The following properties were given to the bullet manager to shoot the pattern above:  
[code][ins=607,17](0, 0);
[ins=606,17](0, 6, 3);
[ins=605,17](0, 3f, 2f);
[ins=604,17](0, 0f, rad(10));[/code]
